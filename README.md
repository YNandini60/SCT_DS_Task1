# SCT_DS_Task1
A histogram or bar chart helps visualize data distribution. Histograms show the spread of continuous values like ages, while bar charts compare categories like gender. These charts make patterns easy to see, highlight trends, and support better decision-making.

# Data Distribution Visualization

This project demonstrates how to visualize categorical or continuous data using Python and Matplotlib.

## Features
- Histogram for continuous data (e.g., Age distribution).
- Bar chart for categorical data (e.g., Gender distribution).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- pandas  
- matplotlib
## Visuals 

Install with:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib

```
## Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python distribution_plot.py
```

## Output

* Histogram shows how values are spread across ranges.
* Bar chart compares counts of categories.

Do you want me to generate **both histogram and bar chart** in the same script, or just keep **one example (age histogram)** for your submission?
```
